A minimalist Flutter game engine.

Any help is appreciated! Comments, suggestions, issues, PRs! Give us a star to show your support!

## Help

We have a Flame help channel on Fireslime's Discord, join it [here](https://discord.gg/pxrBmy4). Also we now have a [FAQ](FAQ.md), so please search for your question there first.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for the common problems every game developed in Flutter will share.

Currently it provides you with: a few utilities, images/sprites/sprite sheets, audio, a physics engine, a game loop and a component/object system.

You can use whichever ones you want, as they are all somewhat independent.
